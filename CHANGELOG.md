## [0.9.1] — 2026-09-13

A portability release. BELFEM 0.9.0 did not build on Ubuntu 24.04 (GCC 13.3), and once it
built, some floating-point convergence and threshold tests used the wrong `abs` overload.
Both problems are fixed. Input files and output formats are unchanged.

### Fixed

- **Floating-point `abs` resolved to the integer C `abs`.** Eleven unqualified `abs()` calls on
  `double` values could bind to `int abs(int)` from `<stdlib.h>`. This happens with libstdc++
  when no header in the include chain declares `::abs(double)`. The argument was then truncated
  to an integer, so any residual below 1 counted as zero. All eleven calls now use `std::abs`.
  Affected code:
  - `Metal::set_RRR` (`cl_Material_Metal.cpp`): the secant loop for the residual resistivity
    `rho_0` never ran, so metals using this path kept the initial guess. In the verified YBCO case
    the thermal conductivity was off by −0.94 % at 20 K. This is what failed
    `YBCOThermalConductivity.RepresentativeTemperaturesAreFinitePositive`.
  - `Metal` Debye-temperature inversion, the YBCO thermal-expansion plateau and c<sub>p</sub>
    switch searches, and the root searches in `Alloy` and `HastelloyC276`.
  - `Tmatrix` (`cl_FEM_Tmatrix.cpp`): matrix entries with magnitude below 1 were dropped from
    the sparsity pattern.
  - `fn_Mesh_ratio.cpp`: the secant loop for the mesh grading ratio.
  - `belfem` (`belfem.cpp`): the thermal/electromagnetic time-synchronisation loop could exit
    while the two clocks still differed by almost 1 s.

  Builds that already found the `double` overload produce the same results as before. On
  affected builds, material properties and coupled thermal/electromagnetic transients may
  change, because the truncation defect is removed.
- **Build failure with `-Werror=format-security`.** Ubuntu's GCC driver injects
  `-Wformat-security` by default, which turned two warnings into errors under BELFEM's
  `-Wall -Werror`:
  - `Logger` (`cl_Logger.hpp`) passed an already formatted message to `fprintf` as the format
    string. A `%` in a message, such as a file path or `50%`, was read as a conversion
    specifier, which is undefined behaviour on every platform. The message is now printed
    with `"%s"`.
  - `sprint()` (`fn_sprint.hpp`) forwards a caller-supplied format by design, and its GCC
    pragma block now also suppresses `-Wformat-security`.
